Movement :
Movement is one of the most important things in TNT-Wizards.
You always need to get in range and in many situations good positioning is the key to victory.
As such all Wizard-Players should have a good sense for the movement.
There are at base (without abilities) four forces that influence your position.

First, there is gravity which is often overlooked but a powerful tool, as falling is faster as the other basic movement options. 
Letting yourself fall is a great way to dodge.
Then there is walking or running if you hold down sprint. 
It is faster than in normal Minecraft as you have a constant speed buff and you should always run as hunger is nonexistent. 
Even in the air you can use it to move whilst for example you fall. 
Then there is the normal jump, which is higher than normal as you have jump-boost. 
At last the most important movement option is the double-jump. 
It can be activated by hitting the spacebar (or whatever key you are using for jumping) twice in rapid succession. 
This will apply an upwards force as well as a force in the direction you looked. 
As there is no cooldown you can effectively use it to « fly ». 
Just remember to look in the direction you want to travel and to spam spacebar.

Using all of these options you can make some pretty awesome maneuvers, so just try them out.
